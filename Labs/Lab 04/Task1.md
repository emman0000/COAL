Task 1

1. What errors are present in the following?
MOV AX 3d
-Missing a comma in between AX and 3d
MOV 23, AX
-The destination operand must be a register or memory location, but 23 is an immediate value, which is invalid.
MOV CX, CH
-These are both from the same general purpose register so it is not possible to perform this operation 
MOVE AX, 1h
- MOVE is not a valid term so it is not possible.
ADD 2, CX
-The order in this is wrong , you cannot write a value 
ADD 3, 6
-Two numbers cannot be added like this directly instead addition can only be done using two registers and storing the value in them
INC AX, 2
-Increment can only be done by 1 and not 2
